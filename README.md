# **TPA-3: YOLOv8++ for Overlap Object Detection in Cluttered Indoor Shots**

## **Overview**
This project implements a modified version of YOLOv8 (termed YOLOv8++) for detecting overlapping objects in cluttered indoor environments. The model is invariant to sensor types, lighting conditions, and affine transformations. 

The project introduces an additional head to the YOLOv8 architecture for improved detection. It uses a custom dataset augmented from a base dataset obtained via Roboflow.

## **Data and Resources**
### **Custom Dataset**
- Augmented dataset in COCO format: `stationaryaug.zip`
- Original dataset source: [Roboflow Stationary Items Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/national-university-fast/stationary-items-dataset/dataset/8)

### **Model Artifacts**

- Finetuned head model (100 epochs): `100epochsbest.pt`
- YAML configuration for the custom YOLOv8++ architecture: `ultralytics/cfg/models/v8/yolov8x-2xhead.yaml`

### **Directory Structure**
- **YOLOV8++ Drive Link**: [Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z78FACvcam31CxOse2aGdolgLaJXjsnV?usp=sharing)
  - `stationaryaug.zip` (Augmented Dataset)
  - `ultralytics.zip` (Modified YOLOv8 Source Code)
  - `100epochsbest.pt` (Trained Model)

## **Installation**
1. Clone the [Ultralytics Repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
2. Replace the contents with the modifications in `ultralytics.zip`.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. **Unzipping Files**  
   Unzip the provided datasets and code:
   ```bash
   !unzip /content/drive/MyDrive/YOLOV8++/ultralytics.zip -d /content/
   !unzip /content/drive/MyDrive/YOLOV8++/stationaryaug.zip -d /content/
   ```

2. **Load Pretrained Model**
   ```python
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   model = YOLO("yolov8x.pt")  # Load a pretrained YOLOv8 model
   ```

3. **Finetune the Model**
   (Not necessary as the pre-trained model is provided.)
   ```python
   results = model.train(data='/content/stationary/data.yaml', freeze=22, epochs=100, imgsz=640)
   ```

4. **Load Finetuned Model**
   ```python
   model = YOLO("/content/drive/MyDrive/YOLOV8++/100epochsbest.pt")
   ```

5. **Add Additional Head**
   ```python
   state_dict = torch.load("yolov8xfin.pth")
   model_2 = YOLO('ultralytics/cfg/models/v8/yolov8x-2xhead.yaml', task="detect").load('yolov8x.pt')
   model_2.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
   ```

6. **Run Predictions**
   ```python
   result_merged = model_2.predict(test_image)[0]
   ```

7. **Visualize Results**
   ```python
   show_output([result_coco.plot(), result_custom.plot(), result_merged.plot()])
   ```

---

## **Custom Modifications**
### **Key Architectural Changes**
- **Additional Head**
  Added a `ConcatHead` layer in `ultralytics/ultralytics/nn/modules/conv.py`.
  ```python
  class ConcatHead(nn.Module):
      ...
  ```

- **Updated YAML Configuration**
  Modified the YAML file `ultralytics/ultralytics/cfg/models/v8/yolov8x-2xhead.yaml` to integrate the new head.

---

## **Results**
- The modified model successfully detects overlapping objects in cluttered environments, as demonstrated in the test images.
- Outputs include predictions from the base COCO model, the finetuned stationary model, and the merged YOLOv8++ model.
